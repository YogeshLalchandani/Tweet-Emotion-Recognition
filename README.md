# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition
In this project I have created a recurrent neural network and trained it on a tweet emotion dataset to recognize emotions in tweets. This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain. I have used TensorFlow as machine learning framework and keras for creating the model.
